This repository contains the answer to a challenge in which given an unsorted txt file of words you needed to place them in alphabetical order creating a sorting algorithm to then store them in a new txt file. Once done, the user is able to look for words with their index and viceversa. To do this you need to run our program in Run Configuration and input the desired index or word.

### Instructions
* Project correctly formated in Github should contain: _(15 points)_
  * A decent README.md file with instructions and description of the project
  * A proper .gitignore file
  * The source files ready to be cloned and compiled
* Project on GitHub should contain at least 3 commits from each of the team member’s Github accounts (5 points)
* Proper handling of the files: open, read and close statements _(5 points)_
* “sorteddict.txt” is created correctly _(5 points)_
* Create several classes and methods to modularize properly the code _(5 points)_
* A Linked list should be used to hold the information of the sorted dictionary _(15 points)_
* Arguments accepted as input when executing the app from the command line should generate the correct answers which will be printed out _(10 points)_
* Bonus _(extra points)_: For creating a faster way to search for words leveraging Linked list together with other structure, algorithm or variables: _Up to 15 points_

### Our Solution
* Summarizing the project
  * We created the Linked Dictionary
  * We created different classes
   *
* Instructions on how to set it
up
* It details the main aspects of
the project
* Describe the best way to
collaborate with the project
 * IntelliJ works very slowly, so we worked with Eclipse
* Are visually nice
